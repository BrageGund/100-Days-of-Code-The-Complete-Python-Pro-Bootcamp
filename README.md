# 100-Days-of-Code-The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp

Working through Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.

Each day covers a new concept with a hands-on project. This repository tracks my progress and all project code.

## Progress: Day 11 / 100

## Concepts Covered So Far
- Variables, data types, and string manipulation
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Lists, dictionaries, and nesting
- Beginner projects (calculator, blackjack, etc.)

## Structure
Each day has its own folder (e.g., `/Day01`, `/Day02`) containing the project code and a short description of what was built.

## Goal
Complete all 100 days and build proficiency in Python for use in engineering, robotics, and automation applications.
